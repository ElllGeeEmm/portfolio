    <h2>
      My passion for web development comes from being at the intersection
      of data and people.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I see web development as being the bridge between
      logical data sets designed for machines and intuitive interfaces built
      for people. As a lifelong learner, I find the neverending challenges
      in building these bridges to be an exciting prospect. When Iâ€™m not
      thinking about data, you can find me either binge-watching TV or out
      on a hiking trail with my dog.
